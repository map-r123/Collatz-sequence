Collatz Sequence Program (C++)
**Description**

This program generates the Collatz sequence for a user-provided integer greater than 1.

The Collatz sequence follows these rules:

If the number is even, divide it by 2

If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1

Repeat until the number reaches 1

The program prints each step of the sequence, counts how many steps were required, and allows the user to run the program multiple times.

**How It Works**

User enters a number greater than 1

The program applies the Collatz rules repeatedly

Each resulting number is printed

The program counts how many iterations were required to reach 1

The user is asked if they want to run the program again

**Future Improvements**

Input validation for numbers ≤ 1

Track the largest value reached during the sequence

Refactor logic into reusable functions

Save results to a file

**Concepts Used**

Loops (while, do-while)

Conditional statements (if/else)

User input/output

Basic arithmetic

Counters
